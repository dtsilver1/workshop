# Ocean Protocol Rug Pull Detector â€“ Submission

## Project Overview
This project is a submission for the Ocean Protocol Rug Pull Detector competition (Track 3). The goal is to provide a modular, extensible, and user-friendly platform that flags high-risk Ocean Protocol data pools/tokens, educates users, and lays the foundation for a broader DeFi risk analytics suite.

## What Was Built
- **Frontend:**
  - A modern, component-based web dashboard (Next.js + React + Tailwind) for rug pull risk analysis.
  - UI components for risk scoring, recent scans, educational resources, and a watchlist.
  - Demo-ready and well-documented codebase, located in the `ocean-rug-detector` directory.
  - All available frontend code and resources are included in this submission.

## What Was Not Built
- **Backend:**
  - The backend risk analysis engine (FastAPI/Flask/Node.js) was not completed due to time constraints and hardware issues (older laptop, limited access to required tools, and inability to run Ocean Protocol node plugins).
  - No live blockchain data integration or real-time risk scoring is present in this submission.

## Features Implemented (Frontend)
- **User Interface:**
  - Dashboard for entering and viewing pool/token risk analysis.
  - Risk score card and breakdown of risk factors.
  - Recent scans and watchlist management.
  - Educational resources explaining DeFi risks and rug pull indicators.
- **Component Library:**
  - Modular UI components (accordion, alerts, cards, tables, etc.) for extensibility and rapid development.
- **Design:**
  - Clean, modern, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

## Features Planned (Not Implemented)
- **Backend Risk Engine:**
  - Smart contract and token analysis (owner privileges, contract verification, top holders, etc.)
  - Liquidity and market behavior monitoring (liquidity lock, price/volume anomalies, whale activity)
  - Risk scoring and reporting (aggregate findings, downloadable reports)
  - Real-time monitoring, alerts, and Ocean Protocol integration
- **Advanced Features:**
  - Plugin system for new detection modules
  - Multi-chain support (Polygon, BSC, etc.)
  - Community feedback and open API

## How to Use/Review
1. All frontend code is in the `ocean-rug-detector` directory.
2. To run locally:
   - Install dependencies: `pnpm install` (or `npm install` if using npm)
   - Start the dev server: `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`)
   - Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Explore the UI, components, and documentation for a demo of the intended user experience.

## Competition Alignment (from PRD)
- **Creativity / Product Mindset:** Innovative, user-centric, and practical design.
- **Extended Parameters:** Modular, extensible, and supports additional risk factors.
- **Topic-related Enhancements:** Deep Ocean Protocol integration planned.
- **Out-of-the-box Functionality:** Demo-ready frontend, clear documentation, and extensible codebase.

## Limitations & Rationale
- Backend and live risk analysis were not completed due to time and hardware constraints. The focus was on delivering a high-quality, extensible frontend and clear documentation to demonstrate the product vision and user experience.
